The user will either be an aurora hunter or someone who is tired of missing out opportunities. Either way the user will appreciate celestial anomalies. This means that our website will have to look pleasing to the eye. However we don’t want to bombard it with too much information because it will deter people from using it. Therefore we have used a minimalist approach. This is good because it also decrease site loading times. 
We will use bootstrap to create a template and configure it to suit the website. The navigation will be straight forward and easy to use. For the colour we decided to go for this darker scheme because there’s a chance that the user will be staring into the dark for a long time and we don’t want to give them eye sore.
