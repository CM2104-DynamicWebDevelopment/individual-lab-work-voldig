The name of our app is based on the Latin word for eclipse

Our web-based app will provide ways of determining the celestial events happening in near future in a given location. The application will determine the location of the person using the app based on the browser location or ask the user to input location. The basic interface will provide a probability of the most common events in percentages. Moreover, our app will provide a weather forecast -  it does not matter if there is something beautiful happening if you cannot see it.  

Our app will provide basic information to anyone from a regular person to expert. For people that are not interested in astrology on an everyday basis it will provide basic reminders of spectacular events - eclipse, red moon, meteor showers. For a hobbyist, it will provide more statistics and a wider range of facts about the given astronomical event.
